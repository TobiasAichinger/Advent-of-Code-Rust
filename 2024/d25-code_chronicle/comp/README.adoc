This day is very special, since for the first time I managed to solve it using https://github.com/aichingert/mor[mor^] (my own programming language). Some parts still do not work therefore I had to cheat a little when parsing the input, so there is a python script in the folder to generate the mor file which contains the solution with the input taken from the input folder.
