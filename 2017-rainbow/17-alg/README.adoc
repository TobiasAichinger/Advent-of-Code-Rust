= Algol 60

How to run this:

* first you need to install https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/marst/[gnu/marst]

after installing gnu/marst you can do (you need sudo because it tries to install a library into usr/local/lib)

[source, sh]
----
./configure; make; sudo make install
----

after doing that you should have the marst binary then you can just use it like this:

[source, sh]
----
marst hello.alg -o hello.c
gcc hello.c -lalgol -lm -o hello
./hello
----

if this throws an error you can see if you have /usr/local/lib listed in a *.conf file which can be found under /etc/ld.so.conf.d and if you had to add it then run

[source, sh]
----
sudo ldconfig
----

after that it should work
