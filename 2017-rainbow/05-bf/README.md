# Brainfuck

I have written an interpreter for brainfuck in the past and am currently trying to also get code generation working for it. 
As this is still a work in progress in one of my other repositories [repositories], when it is finished I will provide the pseudo-code file from which the brainfuck gets generated and the generated Brainfuck.

## How to run the file

I will be using my own interpreter for this which can be found [here]
