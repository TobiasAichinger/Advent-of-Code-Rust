# Advent of Languages 2017

| Day | Language |
| -   | - |
| 0  | [ASM](/01-asm) |
| 02 | [APL](/02-apl) |
| 03 | [D](/03-d) |

# Day 1 - ASM

This is not solved.

# Day 2 - APL

I succeeded in reading the input and partially parse it but not done.

# Day 3 - D

The D language is pretty interesting and I enjoyed it quite a bit. The documentation is a bit weird but not too bad and associative arrays are really usefull.
