## Day 1 - ASM

This is not solved.

## Day 2 - APL

I succeeded in reading the input and partially parse it but not done.

## Day 3 - D

The D language is pretty interesting and I enjoyed it quite a bit. The documentation is a bit weird but not too bad and associative arrays are really usefull.

## Day 4 - Ada

This day was pretty easy and I had no real difficulty in using Ada. The syntax with for using the properties of something like:

```ada

for I in Line'Range loop
    ...
end loop;

```

was pretty unique and interesting. Overall I think the language has almost everything anyone would want but it was a bit too verbose for me with the keywords instead of brackets and the like.

## Day 5 - Brainfuck

This day has it's own README in the folder.

## Day 6 - F#
