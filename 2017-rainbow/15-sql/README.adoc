= PL/SQL

I am using podman to create an oracle database to run my plsql script

first you connect to the container with sqlplus (to create the container run the setup script)

[source,sh]
----
podman exec -it oradb sqlplus / as sysdba
----

within you gotta paste the procedure (I am not sure how to import the file yet)

after that you can

[source,sql]
----
set serveroutput on

exec (procedure name)
----
